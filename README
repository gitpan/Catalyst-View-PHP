NAME
    Catalyst::View::PHP - Template View Class

SYNOPSIS
        # use the helper
        create.pl view PHP PHP

        # lib/MyApp/View/PHP.pm
        package MyApp::View::PHP;

        use base 'Catalyst::View::PHP';

        1;
    
        # Meanwhile, maybe in an '!end' action
        $c->forward('MyApp::View::PHP');

DESCRIPTION
    This is the "Template" view class. Your subclass should inherit from
    this class. The plugin renders the template specified in
    "$c->stash->{template}" or "$c->request->match". The template variables
    are set up from the contents of "$c->stash", augmented with "base" set
    to "$c->req->base", "c" to $c and "name" to "$c->config->{name}". The
    output is stored in "$c->response->output".

    If you want to override PHP config settings, you can do it there by
    setting "__PACKAGE__->config->{OPTION}" as shown in the synopsis.

  METHODS
   process
    Renders the template specified in "$c->stash->{template}" or
    "$c->request->match". Template variables are set up from the contents of
    "$c->stash", augmented with "base" set to "$c->req->base", "c" to $c and
    "name" to "$c->config->{name}". Output is stored in
    "$c->response->output".

   config
    This allows your view subclass to pass additional settings to the PHP
    config hash.

BUGS
    There are probably a few as this module is very new along with
    PHP::Interpreter being very new.  Feel free to discuss this module
    on the Catalyst mailing list catalyst@lists.rawmode.org.
